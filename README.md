### CONTRIBUTING

This software is known to work on Ubuntu Linux 24.04 built with Rust 1.81. On my machine, I did three things to make it compile. One, I installed the libunwind-dev package in Ubuntu (for me this was required). Two and three, I put these in a `.cargo/config.toml`:

	[patch.'https://github.com/servo/servo']
	libservo = { path = '../other/servo/components/servo' }

	[env]
	RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP = "crown,script,style_tests"

â€¦where "../other/servo" is a path on my local hard drive to a checkout of <https://github.com/servo/servo>. This is not required, but to me it is good because otherwise cargo will check out a large git repo in place and it will be annoying. The third thing, "env", is currently required by servo UNLESS you run `cargo +nightly`. The requirement for nightly/RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP will be fixed in a soon-upcoming revision of servo.
