This is a UI experiment. Later it may be something else.

## LICENSE

When this code does something, I intend to release it under the MIT license.

Since this version is basically Ratatui sample code plus Fluent translation (try launching with LANG=es or LANG=tok), this particular commit is made available to you under the Creative Commons Zero license.

This was created by Andi McClure. Assistance with translation was given by Fly and the Toki Pona discord.
